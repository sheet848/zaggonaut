# Building a Modern Personal Finance Dashboard with Next.js

## Overview

I built a full-stack personal finance management application that allows users to track their spending, visualize financial trends, and manage recurring subscriptions—all in one intuitive dashboard. This project showcases my ability to build scalable, type-safe web applications with modern technologies.

## The Challenge

Managing personal finances can be overwhelming. Most users need a simple, visual way to understand their spending patterns without cluttering their experience with unnecessary complexity. The goal was to create a clean, responsive application that provides meaningful insights at a glance while allowing detailed transaction management.

## Solution Architecture

### Frontend Stack
I used **Next.js** with **TypeScript** for a robust, performant frontend. TypeScript helped catch bugs early and improved the development experience with better IDE support. **Tailwind CSS** provided rapid styling with a consistent design system, while **Lucide React icons** gave the interface a polished, professional look.

### Backend & Authentication
**Supabase** served as the perfect backend solution, offering both PostgreSQL database and built-in authentication. This eliminated the need for building custom auth logic and provided a secure, scalable foundation for user data management.

### Data Visualization
I integrated **Recharts** to transform raw financial data into beautiful, interactive charts. This helps users quickly identify spending trends and patterns without overwhelming them with numbers.

## Key Features Implemented

**Dashboard Page**: A comprehensive overview displaying total balance, recent transactions, spending by category, and monthly trends through interactive charts. This gives users instant insight into their financial health.

**Transactions Page**: A complete transaction management system where users can log income and expenses, filter by category or date, and track detailed financial records. This serves as the source of truth for all financial activity.

**Recurring Bills Page**: A dedicated interface for tracking subscriptions and recurring payments. Users can see upcoming bills, calculate total monthly obligations, and set reminders—helping prevent missed payments.

## Technical Highlights

The project demonstrates several important development practices:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation ensures code reliability and prevents runtime errors
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth handles secure user management with session persistence
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL schema optimized for efficient queries and data relationships
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable React components with clear separation of concerns
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring usability across all devices
- **Protected Routes**: Proper authorization checks prevent unauthorized data access

## What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of full-stack development. Integrating Supabase taught me how to work with modern Backend-as-a-Service platforms, eliminating boilerplate code while maintaining security. Using Recharts improved my data visualization skills, and managing complex application state with transactions and bills reinforced best practices in React architecture.

## Future Enhancements

The foundation supports easy addition of features like budget tracking with alerts, advanced reporting (monthly/yearly), data export capabilities (CSV/PDF), multi-currency support, and automated bill payment integration.

## Conclusion

This personal finance dashboard demonstrates my ability to build complete, production-ready applications. It combines modern frontend technologies with robust backend services to create a solution that's both technically sound and genuinely useful. The project shows proficiency in Next.js, TypeScript, database design, and user-focused interface design—all critical skills for modern web development.
