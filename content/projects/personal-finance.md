# Building a Smart Personal Finance Dashboard

## What I Built

I recently completed a full-featured **Personal Finance Dashboard** that helps users take control of their spending and savings with real-time insights. The app is a modern, production-ready solution built with cutting-edge web technologies.

## Key Features

**Dashboard Overview** — Get instant visibility into your financial health with total balance, income, and expense summaries at a glance.

**Transaction Management** — Track every transaction with a comprehensive list featuring advanced filtering and sorting capabilities. Built-in pagination keeps the interface smooth and responsive.

**Recurring Bills Tracking** — Monitor recurring expenses with ease. The app intelligently groups and summarizes your bills, so you never miss a payment.

**Spending Analytics** — Visualize your spending patterns with expense category charts and spending velocity graphs that reveal your financial trends over time.

**Secure Authentication** — Built-in logout features and secure session management ensure your financial data stays protected.

## Tech Stack Behind the Scenes

This project showcases modern full-stack development:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript for type-safe, performant UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for clean, responsive design
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts library for beautiful, interactive charts
- **Backend & Auth**: Supabase for real-time database and authentication
- **Code Quality**: ESLint configuration for maintainable code

## Why I Built It

Personal finance management shouldn't be complicated. Most apps either lack features or overwhelm users with unnecessary complexity. This dashboard strikes the balance—powerful analytics wrapped in an intuitive interface.

Whether you're saving for a goal, tracking expenses, or understanding your spending habits, this tool makes financial management accessible and insightful.

## What's Next

The foundation is solid, and I'm continuously improving:
- Enhanced UI refinements in progress
- creating new sections like Budget and Pots

**Building this dashboard taught me valuable lessons about state management, real-time data synchronization, and creating intuitive financial interfaces. If you're interested in personal finance tools or modern web development, I'd love to hear your feedback!**
