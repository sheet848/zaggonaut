# Building an AI Resume Analyzer with Serverless Technology

## Introduction

Job hunting often fails silently—not because of skill gaps, but because resumes don’t align with Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). To solve this, I built an **AI Resume Analyzer** that compares resumes against job descriptions and provides actionable feedback, ATS scores, and improvement tips.

What makes this project different is the architecture: **no backend code, no infrastructure setup, and zero hosting cost**. Everything runs on the frontend using **Puter.js**, a platform that brings authentication, storage, databases, and AI directly to the browser.


## The Features
The AI Resume Analyzer is a full-stack application that:

- Accepts PDF resume uploads with drag-and-drop
- Matches resumes against job descriptions
- Generates comprehensive ATS scores (0-100)
- Provides AI feedback across 4 categories
- Stores all data securely in the cloud

## The Future
